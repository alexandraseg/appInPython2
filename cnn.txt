London (CNN)Four years ago, thousands of foreigners living in the UK, many of them students, began receiving letters ordering them to leave the country or face deportation.

For others, the first sign that their visa had been revoked was a knock on the door from immigration officials bearing an arrest warrant.
These students, many from India and nearby countries, were accused of cheating on an English language test known as TOEIC by using someone else to sit their speaking exam.
It was one of several tests approved by the British government for non-EU citizens applying for a visa to study or work in the UK. Those who are granted a visa and move to the UK must retake the test every two years.
In the first two years after the accusations emerged, the UK Home Office revoked or refused more than 28,000 visas and deported more than 4,600 people on the basis of the claims, according to a 2016 report by the parliamentary Home Affairs Committee, a cross-party group of members of Parliament who scrutinize the department's policies.
But the Home Office is facing serious allegations of wrongdoing from MPs and senior judges regarding its handling of the issue.
It is not the only set of accusations currently levelled at the department, which has been accused of subjecting legal migrants to its "hostile environment" policy, which was designed to target people in the country illegally.
Dozens of cases have emerged recently of Afghan interpreters who served with the British military and members of the so-called Windrush generation from Commonwealth countries being wrongly deported or threatened with removal -- and the Home Affairs Committee is now calling for "root and branch reform" of the Home Office.
